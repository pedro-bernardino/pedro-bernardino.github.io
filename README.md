## <span style="color:#0984e3">**About me**</span>
Civil engineer working in a career change, turning my hobby into a full-time job.<br>

Self-motivated and adaptable Junior Developer with a passion for technology and a strong foundation in a wide range of programming languages and tools.<br>

Starting with hands-on projects in embedded systems using Arduino, I expanded my expertise into Python for data scraping and automation, iOS and macOS development with Swift, and server technologies like Proxmox and Docker for virtualization and containerization.<br>

My self-learning journey culminated in earning the Oracle Certified Associate (OCA) Java SE certification, enhancing my understanding of object-oriented programming and application development. 

Enthusiastic about solving real-world problems through code, I’m committed to continuous growth, exploring emerging technologies, and building efficient, scalable solutions.

## <span style="color:#0984e3">**Self-Learning Journey in IT**</span>
My journey into software development began with a hands-on approach, exploring diverse technologies and building practical solutions to solve real-world problems. Over time, I transitioned through multiple platforms, languages, and tools:

1. **Arduino Projects (Solar Controller):**  
   - Built a solar battery charge/discharge controller using Arduino to manage battery charge and energy flow effectively.  
   - Gained a strong foundation in electronics, microcontrollers, and programming logic.  

2. **Python Web Scraping (Betting Statistics):**  
   - Developed a Python-based web scraper to gather and calculate betting statistics from online sources.  
   - Strengthened data parsing, automation, and statistical analysis skills.  

3. **macOS Application Development (Objective-C/Swift):**  
   - Created a macOS application to interface with the Betfair API, enabling betting strategies.  
   - Learned Objective-C and Swift, along with API integration and UI design.  

4. **iOS Application Development (Betting Statistics Viewer):**  
   - Designed and deployed an iOS app to display calculated betting statistics from the backend system.  
   - Focused on mobile development, user interface design, and API consumption.  

5. **Proxmox and Docker (Server Virtualization):**  
   - Set up a Proxmox server virtualizing a Linux server with Docker containers with multiple services.  
   - Developed expertise in virtualization, containerization, and Linux-based systems.  

6. **Network Upgrade with Virtualized OPNsense:**  
   - Upgraded a home network by virtualizing OPNsense for enhanced security and traffic management.  
   - Acquired skills in network architecture, virtualization, and firewall configurations.  

7. **Java Oracle Certification:**  
   - Earned the **Oracle Certified Associate (OCA)** Java SE certification, demonstrating foundational knowledge in Java programming, object-oriented principles, and application development.  
   - This milestone formalized my self-taught programming journey and prepared me for professional software development roles.
